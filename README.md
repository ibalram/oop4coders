There are a lot of books which talk about OOP philosophy.
So, if you want to go deeper into OOP paradigm, this isn't your place.
In this book, I want to focus on OOP from developers (programmer's) point of view.
The different implementations of OOP concepts in most object-oriented programming languages.
To this end, I will choose some programming languages, the free ones, to express that.

Though, this book is intended for programmers to learn how to link the OOP concepts with their chosen language, it gives a solution for lazy ones.
If you don't like programming so much, you can use Umbrello UML Modeller which can generate code for various languages.

So, "**Less talking, more coding**"
