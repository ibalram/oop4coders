<img align="left" src="img/book.jpeg">
There are a lot of books which talk about OOP philosophy.
So, if you want to go deeper into OOP paradigm, this isn't your place.
In this book, I want to focus on OOP from developers (programmer's) point of view.
The different implementations of OOP concepts in most object-oriented programming languages.
To this end, I will choose some programming languages, the free ones, to express that.

So, "**Less talking, more coding**"
